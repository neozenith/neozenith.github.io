## Blogging as a release valve for my caffeine consumption

I drink coffee, I like running. So I have a tendency to go from thinking fast to thinking deep. Let's hope for your sake some of it is of value.

## Blog maintenance

```
# May need to edit Gemfile as specific versions of Jekyll are needed for Github
rm -rfv Gemfile.lock

# Ensure Gems are installed
bundle install


bundle exec jekyll serve
```
