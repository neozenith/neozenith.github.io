I'm a senior software engineer but I prefer to think of myself as se√±or software 
engineer.

I am also terrible at puns which also means I am fantastic at dad jokes. It's
like integer overflow for humour.

If you have have found this then there is a good chance you also share an 
interest in software engineering and data analytics or need someone like myself 
to solve those problems for you.

So here is a list of my digital portfolio:

 - [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/622276/neozenith)
 - [Github](https://github.com/neozenith)
 - [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/neozenith)

If you see mention of me as *Josh Wilson*, that is my former name before I took
my wife's family name *Peak*. Yes I am progressive like that, taking my wife's 
family name, but also *Josh Peak* has a more rockstar quality to it and I like that.
