# Going Global: Lessons about Startup Growth

As part of the University of Newcastle opening their new campus NeW Space in 
the Newcastle CBD and in collaboration with UoN Global, the Hunter Young Professionals
organised for myself and Grame Barty to give presentations about our experiences
of entering into global markets.

## Slide Deck

You can tab through the slides in your own time. I have revised them from the 
originals presented on the night to better accommodate tabbing through in your 
own time.

There are 113 slides and the talk ran for 30 minutes. It's pretty fast paced and
my favourite style of presentation. Any comments or feedback please get in touch 
with me via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/neozenith/">LinkedIn</a>

## Homework

If you haven't read The Lean Startup by Eric Ries, I highly recommend it as it
also captures some of these ideas and lessons.

Follow the link above if you would like to get the audiobook version from 
Audible. Your first book is free. I also receive no commission or profit if 
you follow the link, I just liked the book that much.
