# Scaling: Lessons about Startup Growth

After presenting my talk on scaling in 2017 I was invited to give the same presentation
at the Hunter Business Chamber's monthly business development breakfast series
for March 2018.

## Slide Deck

You can tab through the slides in your own time. I have revised them from the 
originals presented on the night to better accommodate tabbing through in your 
own time.

There are 118 slides and the talk ran for 30 minutes. It's pretty fast paced and
my favourite style of presentation. Any comments or feedback please get in touch 
with me via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/neozenith/">LinkedIn</a>

## Homework

If you haven't read The Lean Startup by Eric Ries, I highly recommend it as it
also captures some of these ideas and lessons.

Follow the link above if you would like to get the audiobook version from 
Audible. Your first book is free. I also receive no commission or profit if 
you follow the link, I just liked the book that much.
