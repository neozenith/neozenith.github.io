# Moving from Jekyll to VuePress

When I started my blog the shortest route to achieving that was 
[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and that had to be a 
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) site.

Well that was 2016 and at some point I got sick of syncing `Gemfile`s just to 
add content. I wasn't doing any Ruby development and there was no future need
for it on my resume.

When I found out that any static site content could be served via github pages
I started some research and landed on [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) for now.

It keeps me in the javascript tooling landscape I'm curating in my career and it 
caters better with colourising code snippets for technical content.

It also allows for custom components, which will be handy as I want to get deeper 
into D3 and blogging about Data Vis projects.

Not saying I'm going to stick with this for ever, but my content is all Markdown files,
so whatever is going to be least cost between those and publishing a static site will 
make me happy.

## How?

1. Delete everything except `_posts/`, `images`
1. Move `_posts` to `blog/posts` according to [the directory guide](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/guide/directory-structure.html)
1. Move `images` to `blog/.vuepress/public/images`
1. `npm install --dev vuepress`
1. `npm run dev`
1. Create the following file `blog/.vuepress/config.js` and follow the instructions at [VuePress Config](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/guide/basic-config.html)
  1. This gives you a title link back to the site home page
1. remove all `layout: ...` entries from the markdown frontmatter as the jekyll frontmatter will conflict
1. `vuepress eject` to eject the default style into `blog/.vuepress` so we can start tweaking details
1. `npm run build`
1. [Follow Snipcarts tutorial](https://snipcart.com/blog/vuepress-tutorial-vuejs-documentation)
1. Circle back to [configuring the default theme](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/theme/default-theme-config.html#homepage).
