# Overview

Every company has data that is important to the business. How well each company is leveraging that data is a completely different question.

When I walk into a company I want to have a language to quantify where they are in that journey of maturing their analytics culture and capabilities. Then explain and guide them on the rest of the journey.

This is the sort of practice I have learnt in my time as a software engineer on how to walk into a legacy code base and apply pressure on specific spots. Just like orthodontic braces, over the course of 6-12 months, the code and the people maintaining it are in a new position and looking a lot better.
