This workshop aims to introduce some machine learning and data science principles. 
By sourcing the datasets, and using Google Colab, the barriers to getting started are lowered.

There is a fully worked example using the classic *Diamonds* dataset.

After that it's up to the students to work through the same steps in their own time on the *Boston House* prices dataset.

Finally there are links to resources that can setup the students up to slake their thirst for statistics and machine learning further.
