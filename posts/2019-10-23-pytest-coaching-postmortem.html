Over time I've realised that frustration is a symptom that <strong>I am the one with poor expectations</strong>.</p> <p>So I went and spoke to everyone on the team individually. In fact I sent them an instant message so no-one could overhear them, they could take their time to answer, and they all gave very honest answers. After 2 I saw a theme but I asked <em>everyone</em>.  I can't emphasise this enough, whilst there was overlap, asking everyone meant I got the full spectrum of issues and everyone had something different as much as they had something in common.</p> <p>The question I asked was <em>“Do you feel like self directed learning has improved? If not what do you think are the barriers?”</em></p> <p>The business motivation is that as we become more proficient, we are able to do more with less people, since we weren’t getting more head count anytime soon.</p> <p>I’ll break them into a few themes and phrase them in the first person to help you hear their voices:</p> <p><strong>Roadmaps / Syllabus</strong></p> <ul><li>I don't know what I don't know
<ul><li>It is hard to name or list the things you don’t know, in order to generate that list of things to study</li></ul></li> <li>I do not have a roadmap of what I should know
<ul><li>Even if I do have a list of what to learn how do I prioritise what to learn first?</li></ul></li> <li>There are a lot opaque terms flying around
<ul><li>I do not know <em>what is relevant</em> to me</li> <li>I do not know <em>why</em> we need it.</li></ul></li></ul> <p><strong>Resources / Time Allocation</strong></p> <ul><li>I do not have starter reference materials
<ul><li>Everyone learns differently though, so providing the same starter materials can be a wasteful activity</li></ul></li> <li>I do not have time to seek training materials</li> <li>If I do have time to seek training materials
<ul><li>Sometimes there are too many resources -&gt; it is overwhelming -&gt; I give up</li></ul></li> <li>I do not have time to train/self-study using those materials in business hours</li></ul> <p><strong>Prioritisation</strong></p> <ul><li>pre-emptive self-study is not seen as a priority.
<ul><li>Eg learning about databricks when there is not an immediate need next week.</li></ul></li> <li>Sprints focus on short term productivity and lose sight of long term development.
<ul><li>I do not appear <em>short term productive</em> even if it has <em>long term benefits</em>.</li></ul></li></ul> <p><strong>Stress / Fatigue / Hurdles</strong></p> <ul><li>The first hurdle is a lot of stress
<ul><li>Approaching a new topic has an anxiety of anticipation of the unknown</li> <li>Every new topic, this stress is there, and it is why I need space in between topics</li></ul></li> <li>Am I already training as fast as I can?
<ul><li>Even with infinite time it has a limit and is exhausting</li> <li>I may already be doing my best and there is no more juice left to squeeze</li></ul></li> <li>Expectations of pace are creating stress, which makes the process slower
<ul><li>I liken this to a CPU overheating and throttling itself</li> <li>Am I creating some of this pace expectation on myself? Am I creating my own stress?</li></ul></li></ul> <p><strong>Invisible Feedback</strong></p> <ul><li>How do we (leadership) know the training and study is working? What does that look like?
<ul><li>Visibility of active study may be in private so if it happens it is hard to see</li> <li>Knowing how to do something proficiently looks like the absence of the &quot;asking questions pain points&quot;.
<ul><li>So it is hard to see the absence.</li> <li>Are the pain point questions changing to different topics?</li> <li>Are the pain point questions getting more complex as the simple things become proficient?</li></ul></li></ul></li> <li>Should we more visibly celebrate wins?</li></ul> <h1 id="workshop"><a href="#workshop" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Workshop</h1> <h2 id="timeline"><a href="#timeline" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Timeline</h2> <p><em>Set expectations</em></p> <p>So the &quot;workshop&quot; preparation started 2 sprints in advance. I sent out an email to the team explaining the steps of what we would do and when we would do it. The upcoming sprint we had already committed work so it was to be in the following sprint.</p> <p><em>The workshop</em></p> <p>We coordinated a day that would be the least disruptive to sit down for 3 hours together, which turned out to be 1-4pm on a Friday afternoon. We did 3x 50 minute blocks with 10 minute breaks. Everyone had their laptops and we wouldn't move on until everyone had their dev environment setup or managed to successfully complete each step. We have remote workers so everyone has video conferencing tools open on their laptops anyhow. So when anyone had an issue we got them to screen share on the call and I tried to get the team to guess at helping each other fix it or see what to try next.</p> <p><em>The homework</em></p> <p>The following Monday and Tuesday were the &quot;homework&quot; days. These were during office hours but everyone was working on the same exercises at the same time, so if they ran into issues they could help each other. So this accidentally became a team bonding activity too.</p> <p><em>Extra credit</em></p> <p>That's where it was supposed to end the toy examples and we get back to our planned sprint work. However some had finished the toy example and were onto merging real contributions to our core library so we took the extra day and got code coverage up from 75% to 84% AND reduced the running time of the test suite from 1.5 minutes to 12 seconds!</p> <p><em>Return on Investment</em></p> <div align="center"><img src="/images/contributors-pytest.png" alt="Line graph with two series about the release history of our library. Total unique contributors and cumulative number of releases. Annotation when pytest workshop happended in September."></div> <p>The next 3 sprints I needed help fleshing out a big chunk of work in our core library which was well defined and could be done in parallel. It was lifting code from our old monolith to the new library AND adding tests.</p> <p>The new CI gatekeeping wouldn't allow the contributions without appropriate test coverage.</p> <p>During these 3 sprints we held Tuesday and Thursday 1 hour code review sessions. Not everyone presented but just who needed help next or was close to getting their PR merged.</p> <p>We managed to triple the unique contributors to our library, which de-risked me and my US counterpart as being the only ones that understood the library.

How well does the <strong>Decisional Balance</strong> stand up when there are new cons thrown at it?</p> <p>This is where the coach comes in for those times when someone is unsure or at risk, they will seek guidance on &quot;Why are we writing tests?&quot; or &quot;I have a tight deadline, can I skip writing these tests?&quot;</p> <p>Remind them of the short term deadline versus the long term benefits of automating the work. Often management use the &quot;I'm the boss&quot; card and engineer forget they have a responsibility to build robust systems.</p> <p>Of course there is a pragmatic trade-off, but the push back from engineering has to be more than zero.</p> <p>Next we will talk about how the TTM stages of change map to ADKAR scores.</p> <h2 id="adkar-scores"><a href="#adkar-scores" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> ADKAR Scores</h2> <p>The <a href="https://www.prosci.com/adkar/adkar-model" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ADKAR score<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a> is away of assessing where someone is at in the stages of change.</p> <blockquote><ol><li><strong>Awareness</strong> of the need to change.</li> <li><strong>Desire</strong> to support the change.</li> <li><strong>Knowledge</strong> of how to change.</li> <li><strong>Ability</strong> to demonstrate skills and behaviours.</li> <li><strong>Reinforcement</strong> to make the change.</li></ol></blockquote> <p>The idea being to rate each of these five aspects on a scale of 1-5 and if any are a 3 or lower stop there.</p> <p>For example:</p> <ol><li>I am aware I drink too much coffee (5),</li> <li>I do not desire to change my coffee behaviours (1)</li> <li>I know how to change my coffee consumption behaviour (4)</li> <li>I have previously demonstrated skills to change coffee consumption over 9 months (4)</li> <li>I have no accountability to reinforce that behaviour right now (1).</li></ol> <p>Focusing on giving me knowledge and skills to reduce my coffee consumption won't make a difference because an earlier score is low.
